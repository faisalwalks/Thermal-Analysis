# Thermal Analysis
Static thermal analysis was performed on different triply periodic minimal surface area structures for two different sets of temperature difference 50-25 Deg C and 70-10 Deg C. Also, the simulations were run for two sets of materials too ABS and Zeolite, with Zeolite's thermal conductivity taken as .17 W/m*K
